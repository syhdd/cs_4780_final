# cs_4780_final
## Train label file
Using a thought of multi-label classfication. Transform each digit(from 1 to 10000) into a classifier with feature (0,9) representing specific digit
Do a normalization on training features based on one thought (the feature value of country_id is 0,1 and others are large, need to normalize)
